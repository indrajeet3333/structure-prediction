# RNA Structure Prediction
## Dynamic Programming Problem for RNA Structure Prediction

The objective is to compute the maximum number of permissible letter pairs from the input sequence of 4 letters (A, C, G, U). For these letters, legal pairs are A-U, U-A, G-C, C-G while others (such a G-A) are illegal. In addition, a pairing between two letters is exclusive, e.g., if a letter U on the sequence that is paired with a letter A, that letter U cannot be paired with another letter A.
